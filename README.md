# Real-time-Facial-Recognition-for-Automated-Attendance-Management--
Due to The Real-time Facial Recognition for Automated Attendance Management potential to automate the process and cut down on errors, facial recognition technology has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. In this study, we propose a real-time facial recognition system for automatic attendance recording in classrooms, offices, and other places. The system uses a deep learning algorithm to recognize faces and compare them to a database of people before matching them. We performed experiments to test the precision and effectiveness of the suggested system, and the results show that it is effective at accurately and quickly recognize faces and recording attendance. Additionally, the system has security features to safeguard user privacy and stop unauthorized access. Overall, this research offers useful perceptions into the growth of facial for automated attendance management and its potential applications in various settings.
